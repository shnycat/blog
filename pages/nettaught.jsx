          What I meant by 'net-taught' is that when you teach or learn something
          by yourself or doing research using the resources provided on the
          internet. I don't actually know if that term exists or not.. I was
          just making up name. lol.

          The others may call it 'self-taught' but I'm too afraid to claim that
          I learnt web development by myself.

          Because a lot of people (especially Indian people) have shared their
          knowledges on all over the internet, such as YouTube, Medium,
          StackOverFlow, etc. where I find myself absorbing information on.

          So, technically I got my knowledge from another person, from people,
          not from myself.

        <p>This just more makes sense for me. But idk.</p>
